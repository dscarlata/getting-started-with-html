    <html><b>My Notes</b><br>
<em>Debbie Scarlata</em><br>
<br>
<Head> The low down on <b>HTML</b></Head><br><body>The Basics</a>
<b>HTML</b> stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.  This is the main type of documents.
Other types of documents can also be plain text, images and videos. A computer
or brower send request via <b>HTTP</b> to a server which inturns sends the information back to the server.
<B>HTML</B> is made of 1- text, what I see, 2 - markups, what it looks like, 3 references to other documents images or other videos, 4 links to other pages.
<br> <v>TAGS</v> documents will have opening tags and closeing tages.  ie ""<name> content</name>" this is refered to as <b>elements</b>.
<br><br>

<b>TAGS</b><br>There are <b>Inline and Void</b> tags. Tags have an opening and closing except for <em><b>Void</b></em> tags, they don't require a closeing. Two examples of tags is to <b>BOLD</b> and to <em>italices</em>.<br>To make something <b>bold</b> you would use a B tag and for italic you would use the EM tag.
<b>NOTE - wish I could figure out how to type an example of how it should be enter!</b><br>
<br><br>
<b>Attributes</b><br>I don't fully understand this one except that <b>Anchor</b> is an example and we learned that "href" can be used
to have a web paged linked within our document.<br><br> <b>Images</b><br> Image tags don't require closing tags. The tag uses the image URL and should contain "alt ="text" this allows for a message to display if something is wrong with the image.<br><br>
<br>You will see tags like 'br'or "p" as a way to use your <b>Whitespace effectively</b>.  "br"
is and <em>inline</em> tag whereas "p" is a <em>block</em> since you can define hight/width.<br><br>
An <b>HTML</b> document cantains both a header and body section, the body is the main focus of this course.<br><p>I have alot to practice as I struggled with some of the stuff we covered.  Two areas for sure that I need to work on is including an image or video into my document' </p> But I will keep trying!
